# Email Classifier

## Overview  
The **Email Classifier** project is a machine learning-based system designed to automatically categorize incoming emails based on sentiment analysis. Utilizing Python libraries such as `simpleGmail`, `sklearn`, `Matplotlib`, `Numpy`, and `Pandas`, this classifier processes and organizes emails with high accuracy.  

## Features  
- **Sentiment Analysis:**  
  - Applied **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** vectorization on a dataset of **30,000 emails**, improving email categorization accuracy.  

- **Machine Learning Model:**  
  - Built an **email classifier** using **Logistic Regression**, achieving an accuracy of **97.8%**, ensuring reliable categorization of emails.  

- **Automation:**  
  - Developed an automated **Python script** that classifies emails as soon as they are received using the `simpleGmail` library.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `simpleGmail` – Email automation  
  - `sklearn` – Machine learning model development  
  - `Matplotlib` – Data visualization
